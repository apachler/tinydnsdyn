This is a basic dynamic client and server for the djbdns DNS 
server 'tinydns' by Dan Bernstein.

REQUIREMENTS:

* Administrative access to a server running tinydns
* Administrative access to a unix box behind your NAT router
* Python install on both client and server

INSTALLATION

To install the server code:

1. Copy script and all files onto your server ie. /etc/tinydns-dynamic/
2. The supplied 'run' script is tailored for debian/ubuntu and may need to be
   changed. Also true for the 'log/run' script
3. Create a password file that contains the password on the first line
4. Symlink this directory into your svscan directory,
   (i.e. "ln $(pwd) /etc/service/" )
5. An existing entry in the tinydns data file should already exist. 
   This script will NOT add one. Only those hosts listed 
   (with prefixes '+' and '=') are able to update their entries.

    For example:

   +groucho.example.com:192.168.0.2:3360
   +groucho.example.com:192.168.0.2
   =groucho.example.com:192.168.0.2:60
   +*.groucho.example.com:192.168.0.2:60
   +*.groucho.example.com:192.168.0.2
 
   Will all get updated if the host groucho.example.com does a request.
   

To install the client code:

1. Copy the 'tinydns-dynamic' script into your DNS client's path ie. /usr/local/bin/
2. Arrange to periodically run the "tinydns-dynamic" program (via cron et al) as:

   tinydns-dynamic --hostname=<myhostname> --remote-server=<mydnsserver> <passfile>

3. The password must obviously be the same and the requested host name must
   exist in the 'data' file.


I take no responsibility for anything that may happen to any of your machines.
That said, let me know if there are any issues.
