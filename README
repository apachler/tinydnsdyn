This is a basic dynamic client and server for the djbdns DNS 
server 'tinydns' by Dan Bernstein.

REQUIREMENTS:

* Administrative access to a server running tinydns
* Administrative access to a unix box behind your NAT router
* Python install on both client and server

INSTALLATION

To install the server code:

1. Copy script and all files onto your server ie. /etc/tinydns-dynamic/
2. The supplied 'run' script is tailored for debian/ubuntu and may need to be
   changed. Also true for the 'log/run' script
3. Ensure the password is updated in the 'run' file
4. Symlink this directory into your svscan directory,
   (i.e. "ln $(pwd) /etc/service/" )
5. For each entry in the 'dynamic' file, an existing entry in the tinydns 
   data file should already exist. This script will NOT add one.

To install the client code:

1. Copy the 'tinydns-dynamic' script into your DNS client's path ie. /usr/local/bin/
2. Arrange to periodically run the "tinydns-dynamic" program (via cron et al) as:

   tinydns-dynamic --hostname=<myhostname> --remote-server=<mydnsserver> <password>

3. The password must obviously be the same and the requested host name must
   exist in the 'data' and 'dynamic' files.


I take no responsibility for anything that may happen to any of your machines.
That said, let me know if there are any issues.
